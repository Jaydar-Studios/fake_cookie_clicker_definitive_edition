<h1>fake_cookie_clicker_definitive_edition</h1>
<p>Hey guys. Jaydar here.
<br>I want another place to document the code of Fake Cookie Clicker: Definitive Edition, so here I am: GitHub.
<br>I'm kind of new to GitHub, so please forgive any formatting mistakes, thanks!</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>For those who don't know, Fake Cookie Clicker: Definitive Edition, or FCC: DE, for short, is a fan-made recreation of the (slightly) well-known web game, Cookie Clicker.
<br>The project's origins start from when I was at school and decided to make my own version of the (slightly-) popular webgame, Cookie Clicker. I called this rip-off "Fake Cookie Clicker"
<br>Several months later, I decided to learn ProcessingJS, so I said: "What am I doing? Clearly I should be making FCC in JS!"
<br><em>And then I did. I made it.</em>
  <br><strong>And the rest is history.</strong></p>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li>This is not a straight decompilation, rather, the code is split up into different files and folders.</li>
  <li type = "circle">There will be "README"s attached to each folder, which will explain info about them, and the files contained inside them.</li>
  <li>Like I said, there might be formatting errors and inconsistentcies, because I'm pretty new to GitHub.</li>
</ul>
