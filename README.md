# fake_cookie_clicker_definitive_edition
Hey guys, Jaydar here.
I want another place to document the code of Fake Cookie Clicker: Definitive Edition, so here I am: GitHub.
I'm kind of new to GitHub, so please forgive any formatting mistakes, thanks!

## Intro
For those who don't know, Fake Cookie Clicker: Definitive Edition, or FCC: DE, for short, is a fan-made recreation of the (slightly) well-known web game, Cookie Clicker.
The project's origins start from when I was at school and decided to make my own version of Cookie Clicker in Scratch, and I called it Fake Cookie Clicker.
Several months later, I decided to learn ProcessingJS, so I said: "What am I doing? Clearly I should be making FCC in JS!"
And the rest is history.
